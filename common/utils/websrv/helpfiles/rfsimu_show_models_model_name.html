Models parameters are defined in the oai configuration file under the section "channelmod.<channel list>". <channel list> describes the parameters for each <model name>. Several <channel list> can be defined, the loaded list is defined by the "channelmod.modellist" parameter. Model names are defined by the channel modelisation "user": for example the model "rfsmu_channel_ue0" is applied by the gNB rfsimulator on the signal received from ue0, the first connecet UE.
