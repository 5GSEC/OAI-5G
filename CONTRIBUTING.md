# Contributing to OpenAirInterface #

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

Please refer to the steps described on our website: [How to contribute to OAI](https://www.openairinterface.org/?page_id=112).

1. Sign and return a Contributor License Agreement to OAI team.
2. Register on [Eurecom GitLab Server](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/users/sign_up) if you do not have any.
   - We recommend that you register with a professional or student email address.
   - If your email domain (`@domain.com`) is not whitelisted, please contact us (mailto:contact@openairinterface.org).
   - Eurecom GitLab does NOT accept public email domains.
3. Provide the OAI team with the **username** of this account to (mailto:contact@openairinterface.org) ; we will give you the developer rights on this repository.
4. The policies are described in these wiki pages: [OAI Policies](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/oai-policies-home).
   - PLEASE DO NOT FORK the OAI repository on your own Eurecom GitLab account. It just eats up space on our servers.
   - You can fork onto another hosting system. But we will NOT accept a merge request from a forked repository.
      * This decision was made for the license reasons.
      * The Continuous Integration will reject your merge request.
   - All merge requests SHALL have `develop` branch as target branch.
   - All merge requests SHALL have source branch names that SHALL not contain the `/` character.
      * We are using a `docker` registry scheme and the image names are based on the source branch name.
